The PDF file corresponding to each assignment and the `.py` files containing the code implementation sections are all located under the corresponding assignment folder. The names of the `.py` files are composed of the main question id and the sub-question id. 

**Note:** The code may contain some minor errors.

The final exam for this course focuses more on theory and related mathematical derivations rather than specific data calculations and applications.

#### Areas for Code Improvement

- Files `1-2-fixed.py` and `1-3-fixed.py` in `Assignment 2` may still contain errors.
- File `3-4.py` in `Assignment 3` might have potential issues.
